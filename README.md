# COVID-19-Dashboard
COVID-19 Dashboard shows various plots of Covid-19 distribution per country.

This dashboard is useful for getting insights on the growth of the Corona Virus in each country. It shows plots for new and active cases, 
number of deaths and number of recoveries each day in a particular country. This is helpful for comparing the distribution among various countries. 
This can also help to determine which countries have taken proper measures to control the growth factor, or, which countries have the best recovery rate.
