# COVID-19-Dashboard
COVID-19 Dashboard shows various plots of Covid-19 distribution per country.

This dashboard is useful for getting insights on the growth of the Corona Virus in each country. It shows plots for new cases,<br>
number of deaths and number of recoveries each day in a particular country. This is also helpful for comparing the distribution among various countries.<br>
This can also help to determine which countries have taken proper measures to control the growth factor, or, which countries have the best recovery rate.
